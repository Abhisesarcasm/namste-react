# PART-1

There are several types of testing a developer can do:-

1. Unit Testing
2. Integration Testing
3. End to End (e 2 e) Testing & etc.

Out of them we are concerned about above 2.

Unit Testing:

What it is: Unit testing involves testing individual units or components of a software independently.
Purpose: It aims to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed.
Scope: Tests focus on isolated parts of the code, such as functions, methods, or classes.
Dependencies: Unit tests typically isolate the unit being tested from external dependencies using mocks or stubs.
Benefits: It helps catch bugs early in the development process, promotes modular code design, and provides fast feedback to developers.
Integration Testing:

What it is: Integration testing checks if individual units work together as expected when integrated.
Purpose: It verifies interactions between different units/modules to ensure they function correctly as a whole system.
Scope: Tests focus on the interfaces between components and their interactions.
Dependencies: Integration tests require real or simulated external dependencies (e.g., databases, APIs, network services).
Benefits: It identifies issues related to interactions between components, validates system behavior, and ensures the integrity of the overall system.
In Summary:

Unit testing is about testing individual pieces of code in isolation to ensure they work correctly.
Integration testing is about testing how those pieces work together as a whole system.

# React testing library (RTL )to write test cases for our react app.(Go & explore Docs)

# Jest is a JavaScript testing framework designed to ensure correctness of any JavaScript codebase. It allows you to write tests with an approachable, familiar and feature-rich API that gives you results quickly. Jest is well-documented, requires little configuration and can be extended to match your requirements.or (Jest is a JavaScript testing framework commonly used for writing unit tests in React applications.)

=> RTL uses JEST behind the scene.
=> So, RTL needs JEST & JEST uses Babel behind the scene.
( npm i -D @testing-library/react & npm i -D jest)

# Setting up Testing in our App

- Install React Testing Library
- Install jest
- Install Babel dependencies
- Configure Babel
- Configure Parcel Config file to disable default babel transpilation
- Jest - npx-jest-init (to configure jest)
- Install jsdom library
- Install @babel/preset-react - to make JSX work in test cases
- Include @babel/preset-react - inside my babel config
- npm i -D @testing-library/jest-dom

# npm run test(for checking test cases eaach time we will run this) & npm run watch-test (auto testing in our terminal whenever we save our changes it will auto run the tests in terminal)

=> Jest using Babel ---> As we are using jest using Babel so for that we need to install dependency which are required to use Babel.
=> Parcel (website) Get Started --> JS --> Babel --> Usage with other tools & copy the code in .parcelrc file.Here, actually we are configuring the Babel. We do this bcoz as in our code earlier we installed parcel so with that Babel also comes along with it.And again here we are configuring the babel so to resolve this conflict we do this. After this we have to configure the babel(babel.config.js).

npx-jest-init ---> after running this then we will get this in our terminal and we have to provide this as below:-

- typescript - no
- 2nd option JS Dom
- yes
- babel
- yes  
  JEST configuration created
  (Everything we provided will be there in JEST configuration.)

RTL(website) -> Setup -> Jest 28 & install the below library and configure it.

# PART-2

(install VS Code icon extension)

We have to write all our test cases inside tests folder.Any file inside this folder will be treated as testing file.
// Header.test.js
// Header.test.ts
// Header.spec.js
// Header.spect.ts
Whichever file matches this above pattern will be a testing file.

the 2 underscores in tests are also known as dunder.

# --save-dev is similar to -D

=>test(_,_) => takes 2 parameters 1st is a string & 2nd is a callback. This is how we write tests.

If , we comment down Assertion then our test case will pass bcoz there is nothing to test.So, that's why Assertion is important.

# PART-3

Unit Testing
=> Let's test that whether Contact Component loads or not.Whether it's loaded on to the DOM or not?

1. Let's check whether the heading is present or not why we are doing it because the render will check all the elements & content & data of that component or that whole component is loaded on to the DOM.
2. Then we use screen because component will be visible in the screen.
3. toBeInTheDocument() -> whether sth is loaded or not we use this. getByRole() -> it will actually check all the heading that are present in our component.
4. Now we get an error that jsx is not enabled for test cases so for that we will add this library by installing npm i @babel/preset-react 7 adding it in babel.config.js. This is basically transpile our JSX code to HTML so that it can read properly.
5. Again we gat an error saying toBeInTheDocument() is not a function.
6. To resolve this we need to install npm i -D @testing-library/jest-dom.

# PART-4

Q=>Why we use describe?
Ans:-because to group test cases so that one group is testing a specific kind of task and other group is testing something else.So, that we can optimally separate test logic & it will be clear to understand the code.

Integration Testing before this we were doing Unit Testing.
=> When multiple components starts working i.e known as integration testing.

=> Now when we render the Body component in Search.test.js then we get error because we jave async await in Body.js which is used to fetch Api data.

=> So, when we test the Body component by render method it is actually rendering the Body component in JS DOM which is browser like not actual browser.So it doesn't have all superpower of browser that's why when I have written fetch API in Body.js the fetch is a superpower of browser not JS DOM.So, to resolve it we have to write/define mock fetch function.

global.fetch = jest.fn(() => {
return Promise.resolve({
json: () => {
return Promise.resolve(MOCK_DATA);
},
});
});

Here, global is the global object in which fetch() function is also attached with it by inspecting we can see it.
As , fetch function returns us a promise which resolve with a json which again returns a promise which again resolve in which data is there.

=> The reason why we use mock fetch function because while teszzting we can't make an actual API call or even if we are offline we can run test cases.The reason is our test cases are running on JS DOM which is Browser like not Browser. So, as it is JS DOM we write the mock fetch function.

=> Whenever we use fetch and whenever code involves state changes then we should wrap it with act function.
=> Act function returns as a promise so for that we have to make it await and it takes a callback function which is a async function & returns the render.
=> As, the test can't understand <Link> tag we wrap it with <BrowserRouter>

# Coverage folder index.html -> open it in live server to see the details about which are the things that are tested & not tested.

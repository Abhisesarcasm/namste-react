Higher Order Component is a component which takes a component as input & return the enhanced version of that component.

Sometime some food items have price or sometimes default price in their api data.So, we used ternary operator for that.
i.e {item.card.info.price? ( item.card.info.price / 100 ) : ( item.card.info.defaultPrice / 100 )}

If one accordion is expanded then others should be collapsed.It's a very important feature please make sure to analyze it how it applied here.

(React Developer Tools Extension)===> It gives us 2 tabs in our Chrome Dev tools:-

1. Components
   Purpose: Displays the hierarchical structure of React components in your application.
   ( Here, we can also see the state of the Accordion element when we click on them in Component section. )
   Usage: Allows developers to inspect the current state and props of each component, view the component tree, and explore the relationships between components.

2. Profiler
   Purpose: Provides performance profiling tools to analyze the rendering performance of your React application.It also records our activity/actions in our React App.
   Usage: Helps identify performance bottlenecks, measure component render times, and optimize the application for better user experience by identifying areas that may cause delays or slow performance.

# Important :-

We don't want that <RestrauntCategory> to control the expansion or collapsing of accordions it should be done by its parent <RestrauntMenu>. So, in this case parent is controlling the child component so here <RestrauntCategory> which is child component
of <RestrauntMenu> is a controlled component instead of being a uncontrolled component.

# In React, Controlled components refer to the components where the state and behaviors are controlled by Parent components while Uncontrolled components are the ones having control of their own state and manage the behaviors on themselves.

---> A child which is totally dependent or mostly depended on props and doesn't have any local state variable is also a Controlled components.

# Props Drilling concept

=> Passing data from one component to another is a tough job/task also data flow in react is unidirectional(parent to child) i.e top to bottom.

(Read about props drilling and lifting state up in React.dev docs.)

=====> In large scale application where there are multiple components with a hierarchy i.e parent component its child it's child & so on.

Let's say the leaf component(child) at any level wanted to access the top parent component data then there are 2 ways:-

1. Props Drilling
   --> Parent will pass props data to its child that child will pass to its child and so on until the desired leaf is encountered.So, it's a very lengthy and and not a optimised way to pass data.

2. To avoid it we use React Context
   --> React context which is kind of a global space / a thing anybody can access it from anywhwere.
   --> For that data we hold the context & it can be accessed from anywhere in our App.
   --> And we created [context]file (UserContext.js) in the utils folder to be more specific.
   --> Only, those datas which we feel that they are needed in multiple places ; only that one should be treated as Context.

   -> React Library gives us createContext which returns a context object.
   -> (useContext is also a React Hook.)
   -> We can create mutliple context in our App.

2 ways to consume context or to access the context:-

1. In Class-based component == by using .Consumer
2. In Functional component == by using useContext() hook.

# <UserContext.Provider> in App.js

--> We can use <UserContext.Provider> multiple times in our component.
In the provided code snippet, UserContext.Provider is a component used in React's Context API. In the Context API, a context provider is responsible for supplying the context values to its child components.

Here's a breakdown:

UserContext:

Presumably, UserContext is a React context that has been created using createContext elsewhere in the code. It defines a context object that can hold certain values.
UserContext.Provider:

.Provider is a component that comes with the context created using createContext. It is used to wrap around parts of the component tree where you want to make the context values available.
The value prop of UserContext.Provider is crucial. It takes an object that contains the values you want to share with components that are descendants of this provider. In your example, it provides a loggedInUser (presumably the user's name) and a setUserName function.
Usage:

1. Shares the loggedInUser (presumably the user's name) and setUserName function with all components wrapped within it, making this data and function accessible throughout the component tree. This is particularly useful for sharing global state or functions without the need to pass props manually through each level of the component hierarchy.
2. By wrapping components within UserContext.Provider, those components and their descendants gain access to the values provided in the value prop without explicitly passing them down through props. This is especially useful for sharing state or functions across multiple components in a cleaner way.
3. In summary, UserContext.Provider is setting up a context provider for the UserContext and sharing specific values with its child components. Components within the provider can then access these values without the need for prop drilling.

# Important Note

Certainly! In React, the code you provided is using the UserContext.Provider to wrap the components within the div with the class name "app." This indicates that these components will have access to the values provided by the UserContext.

The value prop of UserContext.Provider is used to pass down the values to the components that are descendants of this provider. In your case, the value is an object with two properties: loggedInUser and setUserName.

loggedInUser seems to be a variable holding the username of the logged-in user.
setUserName is likely a function used to update the username.
When you mention value={{ loggedInUser: userName, setUserName }}, it means you are providing the current username (userName) as the loggedInUser, and the function to set the username (setUserName) to the components within the UserContext.

If it's not working when you don't include setUserName in the value, it suggests that the components within the UserContext.Provider expect to have access to both the current username and the function to update it. If you exclude setUserName, the components might not be able to modify the username, leading to unexpected behavior if they try to do so.

To debug the issue further, you might want to check the components that are using UserContext and see if they rely on both loggedInUser and setUserName. If setUserName is necessary for updating the context, not including it in the value could result in issues when trying to update the state.
